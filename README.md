## CAD Swing Arm 

### Description

The first assignment was to replicate a swing arm part from a set of drawings. The assignment style was similar to a portion of the Onshape Associate Certification test.

### Reflection
Creating this part from a drawing was more difficult than I expected. Combining the different drawing views with the various dimensions took several tries. Even though the part was made with simple extrudes, they were combined in relatively complex ways. Next time, I will spend more time analyzing the drawings before I actually start making the part!
